Last Updated: November 18, 2025

## Purpose
Provide a quick comparison of major accreditation programs and how they align to CMS Conditions of Participation (CoPs) and international quality frameworks.

---

## Major Programs
- The Joint Commission (TJC) – U.S. and global (JCI internationally)
- DNV Healthcare – NIAHO standards, ISO integration
- ACHC / HFAP – programs for hospitals and other settings
- NCQA – health plan and program accreditation; Health Equity Accreditation
- URAC – health plan, telehealth, pharmacy benefit management
- CARF – rehabilitation facilities

Refer to each program’s current manual for authoritative text; this overview is for navigation only.

## Choosing a Path
- Setting and scope (hospital vs. ambulatory vs. health plan)
- Deemed status needs (Medicare participation)
- Culture fit (ISO-based continuous improvement vs. prescriptive standards)
- International presence and brand recognition

---

## Crosswalk Strategy
1. Build a standard-to-tag crosswalk (Accreditation Standard → CMS CoP Tag).
2. Identify overlaps with infection prevention, QAPI, and patient rights.
3. Use tracer methodology to validate end-to-end compliance.
4. Keep a living evidence map (policies, training, logs, meeting minutes).

---

## Equity Integration
- Ensure health equity requirements (data stratification, CLAS, language access) are embedded in QAPI and patient rights.
- Leverage NCQA Health Equity Accreditation as a complementary framework for plans and networks.
