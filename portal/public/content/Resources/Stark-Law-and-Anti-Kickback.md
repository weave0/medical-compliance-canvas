# Stark Law & Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS)

## Practical Guide for Financial Relationships in Healthcare

Last Updated: November 18, 2025

---

## Why This Matters
Improper financial relationships drive enforcement actions, repayments, corporate integrity agreements, and reputational harm. Stark is strict liability (no intent required). AKS is criminal (intent-based) but broadly interpreted. Both can trigger False Claims Act exposure.

---

## Quick Definitions
- Stark Law (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn): Prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients for designated health services to an entity with which they (or an immediate family member) have a financial relationship, unless an exception applies. Strict liability.
- Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)): Prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or reward referrals for items/services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program. Intent-based; safe harbors provide protection.

## Designated Health Services (DHS) – Examples
- Clinical lab services, PT/OT/Speech, Radiology & imaging, DME & supplies, Home health, Outpatient prescription drugs, Inpatient & outpatient hospital services. Confirm current DHS list at CMS.

---

## Common Exceptions (Stark) & Safe Harbors (AKS)
- Stark exceptions often used: bona fide employment, personal services arrangements, fair market value (FMV) compensation, leases (office space/equipment), non-monetary compensation limits, group practice in-office ancillary services.
- AKS safe harbors often used: space/equipment rental, personal services/management contracts, employment, group purchasing organizations, warranties, discounts, certain value-based arrangements (check current rules).

Always confirm each element (writing, term, set-in-advance, FMV, commercially reasonable, not volume/value-based).

---

## 2024–2025 Monitoring Topics
- Value-based safe harbors/definitions (ongoing adoption and clarification).
- Patient support programs, digital health/vendor remuneration scrutiny.
- Fair market value documentation standards.
- OIG Advisory Opinions; DOJ enforcement trends.

Check OIG, CMS, and Federal Register updates before finalizing arrangements.

## Practical Implementation Checklist
1. Inventory all financial relationships (physicians, advanced practice providers, vendors).
2. Map each to the appropriate Stark exception and/or AKS safe harbor.
3. Validate FMV: third-party appraisal or defensible methodology; document contemporaneously.
4. Confirm commercial reasonableness independent of referrals.
5. Ensure agreements are signed, dated, term-compliant, and set-in-advance.
6. Track non-monetary compensation caps and incidentals.
7. Centralize contracts; calendar expirations and required renewals.
8. Train leadership and managers on prohibited conduct and red flags.
9. Establish intake/review workflow for new arrangements (legal/compliance sign-off).
10. Audit sample payments and timesheets vs. contract terms.

---

## Red Flags & Pitfalls
- Payments tied to referral volume/value (directly or indirectly).
- Back-dated contracts; unsigned or expired agreements.
- Above-FMV compensation; inadequate documentation of services.
- "Medical director" roles with little evidence of duties performed.
- Free/subsidized staff, space, or IT without meeting an exception/safe harbor.

---

## Documentation to Keep
- Executed agreements and amendments
- FMV analyses and data sources
- Needs assessments/commercial reasonableness memos
- Time logs, invoices, board approvals
- Annual non-monetary compensation logs
