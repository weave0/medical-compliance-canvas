# EMTALA – Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act

## Emergency Screening, Stabilization, and Transfer Requirements

Last Updated: November 18, 2025

---

## Scope & Applicability
EMTALA applies to Medicare-participating hospitals with an emergency department. It requires a medical screening examination (MSE) to determine if an emergency medical condition (EMC) exists, stabilization of EMCs, and appropriate transfers when necessary—without consideration of insurance or ability to pay.

---

## Core Obligations
1. Medical Screening Examination (MSE) provided by qualified medical personnel.
2. Stabilization of any identified emergency medical condition, including active labor.
3. Appropriate transfer if the hospital lacks capability/capacity—document risks/benefits and obtain acceptance from receiving facility.
4. On-call physician coverage and timely response.
5. Signage informing patients of EMTALA rights.
