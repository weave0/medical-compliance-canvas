# Value-Based Care & Payment Models
## Quality, Outcomes, and Health Equity in Payment Reform

**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025

---

## Overview

Value-based care shifts healthcare payment from volume (fee-for-service) to value (quality outcomes at lower cost). **2025 is a tipping point** - majority of U.S. healthcare payments now include value-based components.

**Why Critical:** Payment increasingly tied to health equity metrics.

## Contract Considerations for Providers

### Key Elements

#### 1. Attribution Methodology
How are patients assigned to provider/organization?
- Prospective vs. retrospective
- Claims-based vs. voluntary alignment

#### 2. Benchmarking
What's the comparison?
- Historical performance (self)
- Regional peers
- National averages

#### 3. Risk Sharing
**Upside only:** Share in savings  
**Two-sided:** Share savings AND losses  
**Full risk:** Capitation

#### 4. Quality Measures
- **Clinical quality** (HEDIS, ACO measures)
- **Patient experience** (CAHPS)
- **Equity** (stratified, disparity reduction)

#### 5. Social Risk Adjustment
- Do payments account for SDOH?
- Are there bonus payments for serving high-need populations?

#### 6. Data Sharing
- What data provided by payer?
- How often?
- Format (claims, clinical, ADT feeds)?

---

## Success Factors in VBC

### 1. Data Infrastructure
Must be able to:
- Identify high-risk patients
- Track quality measures
- Monitor costs in real-time
- Stratify by demographics

### 2. Care Coordination
**Essential:** Care managers, navigators, team-based care

### 3. Community Partnerships
**For SDOH:** Can't address housing, food, transportation alone

### 4. Provider Engagement
**Alignment:** Clinicians must understand and support model

### 5. Patient Activation
**Shared decision-making, self-management support**

### 6. Continuous Quality Improvement
**Regular PDSA cycles** based on data

---

## ROI & Business Case

### Typical VBC Savings
**Well-run programs:**
- 5-15% reduction in total cost of care
- 10-20% reduction in ED utilization
- 5-10% reduction in hospital readmissions

### Shared Savings Example
**Population:** 10,000 attributed patients  
**Baseline Cost:** $10,000 per member per year = $100M total  
**Achieved Savings:** 10% = $10M  
**Shared Savings Rate:** 50%  
**Payment to Provider:** $5M

**Must invest:** Care managers, CHWs, data systems (~$2-3M)  
**Net gain:** $2-3M + improved patient outcomes

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Inadequate data infrastructure** - can't manage what you can't measure
2. **Underestimating care coordination costs** - navigators, CHWs essential but expensive
3. **Ignoring equity** - disparities can worsen if not explicitly addressed
4. **Poor risk adjustment** - serving sicker populations penalized unfairly
5. **Misaligned incentives** - some providers still in FFS while organization in VBC
6. **Insufficient community partnerships** - SDOH requires external resources
