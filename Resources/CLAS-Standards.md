## Language Access Best Practices

### Qualified Interpreter Standards

**Medical interpreters must have:**

- Knowledge of interpreting techniques
- Understanding of medical terminology
- Adherence to interpreter code of ethics
- Cultural competence

**Avoid using:**

- Family members (especially children)
- Untrained bilingual staff
- Google Translate for complex medical communication

### Interpretation Modalities

**In-Person:**

- Best for: Complex discussions, informed consent, sensitive topics
- Challenges: Cost, scheduling, availability

**Video Remote (VRI):**

- Best for: Sign language, visual cues needed
- Advantages: Faster access than in-person

**Phone:**

- Best for: Quick interactions, multiple languages
- Available: 24/7 through language lines

### Translation Best Practices

**Documents to translate (minimum):**

- Consent forms
- Patient rights and responsibilities
- Discharge instructions
- Financial policies
- Signage (waiting areas, wayfinding)
- Patient education materials (top conditions)

**Process:**

1. Professional translation
2. Independent back-translation
3. Community review
4. Pilot testing with patients
5. Periodic updates

## Case Study: CLAS in Action

**Scenario:** Community health center serving 40% Spanish-speaking patients

**Baseline Issues:**

- High no-show rates among Spanish-speaking patients
- Low diabetes control rates in this population
- Patient complaints about communication

**CLAS Interventions:**

1. **Standard 5-7:** Hired bilingual medical assistants, contracted 24/7 Spanish interpretation
2. **Standard 8:** Translated all diabetes education materials, created Spanish-language signage
3. **Standard 10:** Collected language preference data in EHR
4. **Standard 11:** Formed Spanish-speaking patient advisory group
5. **Standard 4:** Monthly cultural competency training for all staff

**Results (18 months):**

- No-show rate decreased 30% among Spanish-speaking patients
- HbA1c control improved 15% in this population
- Patient satisfaction scores increased from 72% to 91%
- Zero language-related complaints
