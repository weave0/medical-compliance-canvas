## Intersection with CLAS Standards

### Complementary Frameworks

**Section 1557 = Legal Requirement**  
**CLAS Standards = Best Practice**

| Section 1557 | CLAS Standards |
|--------------|----------------|
| Language assistance (required) | CLAS Standards 5-8 (how to do it well) |
| Nondiscrimination notice | CLAS Standard 6 (notification) |
| Grievance procedure | CLAS Standard 13 (conflict resolution) |
| Data collection (implied) | CLAS Standard 10 (explicit) |

**Strategy:** Use CLAS Standards to operationalize Section 1557 compliance comprehensively

---

## Risk Areas & Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios

#### 1. Family Member as Interpreter
**Risk:** Violates Section 1557 (except emergencies)  
**Mitigation:** Always offer qualified interpreter, document patient refusal if declined

#### 2. "English Only" Policies
**Risk:** National origin discrimination  
**Mitigation:** Eliminate such policies, embrace multilingual communication

#### 3. Inaccessible Medical Equipment
**Risk:** Disability discrimination  
**Mitigation:** Acquire accessible exam tables, scales, mammography equipment

#### 4. Transgender Exclusions in Coverage
**Risk:** Sex discrimination (subject to evolving case law)  
**Mitigation:** Conduct individualized coverage reviews, consult legal counsel

#### 5. Separate Waiting Areas by Language
**Risk:** Segregation violates civil rights  
**Mitigation:** Integrated facilities with language assistance available to all
