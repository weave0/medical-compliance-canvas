# Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Resources
## Addressing Root Causes of Health Disparities

**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025

---

## Overview

Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) are the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.

**Why Critical for 2025:** CMS, NCQA, and Joint Commission now require SDOH screening and intervention programs.
