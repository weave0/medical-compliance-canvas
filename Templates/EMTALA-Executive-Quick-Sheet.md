# Executive Quick Sheet – EMTALA

Last Updated: November 18, 2025

---

## Why It Matters
- Federal mandate for ED screening/stabilization regardless of ability to pay

## Top 5 Actions
1. Maintain current QMP list and MSE policy
2. Train registration, triage, clinicians, and security annually
3. Keep on-call schedules and transfer agreements; document all transfers
4. Audit high-risk cases monthly (psychiatric, active labor, specialist delays)
5. Post required signage; test escalation pathways

## Red Flags
- Transfers based on payer status; on-call no-shows; poor documentation

## Where to Start
- Read: `Resources/EMTALA-Emergency-Treatment.md`
- Use: `Templates/EMTALA-Checklist.md`
