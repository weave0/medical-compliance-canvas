# Executive Quick Sheet – Stark Law & AKS

Last Updated: November 18, 2025

---

## Why It Matters
- Stark is strict liability; AKS is criminal and intent-based
- Violations risk False Claims Act exposure, repayments, CIAs

## Top 5 Actions
1. Inventory all physician/vendor financial arrangements
2. Map to Stark exception / AKS safe harbor; document FMV & commercial reasonableness
3. Execute signed, dated agreements with set-in-advance terms
4. Centralize contracts; calendar expirations and caps (non-monetary comp)
5. Audit timesheets/invoices vs. agreements quarterly

## Red Flags
- Volume/value-based pay; back-dated/expired agreements; above-FMV comp

## Where to Start
- Read: `Resources/Stark-Law-and-Anti-Kickback.md`
- Use: `Templates/Contract-Review-Checklist.md`, `Templates/Compliance-Tracker.md`
