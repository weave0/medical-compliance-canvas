Last Updated: November 18, 2025

---

## Why It Matters
- Baseline Medicare participation requirements; survey deficiencies can threaten certification

## Top 5 Actions
1. Identify applicable CoP appendix and tag list for your provider type
2. Complete a gap assessment and evidence map; assign owners and due dates
3. Prioritize high-risk tags (patient rights, infection control, EMTALA)
4. Run mock surveys with tracer methodology; close CAPs
5. Maintain continuous readiness dashboards and leadership rounding

## Red Flags
- Recurrent findings, missing evidence, and weak QAPI documentation

## Where to Start
- Read: `Resources/CMS-Conditions-of-Participation.md`
- Use: `Templates/Compliance-Tracker.md`, `Templates/Regulatory-Monitoring-Log.md`
