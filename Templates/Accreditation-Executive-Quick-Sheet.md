## Why It Matters
- Deemed-status accreditation can satisfy CoPs and strengthen quality/safety brand

## Top 5 Actions
1. Choose program fit (TJC, DNV, etc.) aligned to setting and culture
2. Build a standards-to-CoP tag crosswalk and evidence map
3. Integrate equity requirements into QAPI and patient rights
4. Conduct tracers across high-risk workflows; fix system issues
5. Prepare leadership and frontline for survey interviews and documentation

## Red Flags
- Policy-only compliance without operational proof; missing tracer evidence

## Where to Start
- Read: `Resources/Accreditation-Standards-Overview.md`
- See: `Resources/Joint-Commission.md`, `Resources/NCQA-Programs.md`
